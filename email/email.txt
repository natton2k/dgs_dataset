Subject: Assistance Needed: Request for Sign Language Translation Dataset

To whom it may concern,

I hope this email finds you well.
My name is [Your Name], an undergraduate student at FPT University in Vietnam.
Currently, I am undertaking a graduate project focusing on the comparison between multiple models for sign language translation from text to video.

I am seeking a suitable dataset to serve as a baseline for comparing the performance of various models.
Your dataset stands out due to its comprehensive nature, featuring diverse dialogues and individuals from various regions.
I am confident that your dataset aligns perfectly with the requirements of my project.

Unfortunately, I have encountered difficulties in finding a central repository from which I can download the entire dataset.
I am reaching out to you in the hope that if you could show me way to download this dataset.

I intend to utilize this dataset for training different models and for final validation.
I assure you that your dataset will be used responsibly and that proper citation will be given in my project paper.

I look forward to your response.
Please feel free to reach out to me if you require any further information.

Thank you for considering my request.
